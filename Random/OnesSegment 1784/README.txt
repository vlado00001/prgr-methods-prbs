Given a binary string s, without leading zeros, return true if s contains at most one contiguous segment of ones. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: s = "1001"
Output: false
Explanation: The string has two segments of size 1.

Example 2:
Input: s = "110"
Output: true

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 100
    s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
    s[0] is '1'.

Solution:
count keeps the number of transitions. and it must be <= 1.

Complexity:
T: O(n)  // single pass through the string
S: O(1)  // only a counter is used
